# Title: Collaborative Note Taking Project
## Abstract from Dissertation Document

This dissertation describes the development of a collaborative note taking system which aimed to provide an environment for students to create, store, and share notes regarding their course at the University of Bath, alongside allowing users to provide feedback to these notes and interact with other students on their course. The form which this system took was a website which University of Bath students could register to use exclusively, although a future goal of this project would be to allow any student to have access to this system and make it more general purpose than specific.

## Status of Project

There are no plans to release this system, nor continue development of this system; although the idea for this system is fine, this project involved learning a number of different libraries thus a number of different files need work. Furthermore, the approach taken for implementing this system would be somewhat revised.

## Information about the System

This website was created using React, Bootstrap, ExpressJS, and MySQL for the frontend, styling, the backend, and dbms respectively. Further information about packages can be found within the package.json files within the client and server folders respectively.
