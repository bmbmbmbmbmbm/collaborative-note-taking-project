# Title: Collaborative Note Taking Project

This is a final year dissertation project aimed at providing University of Bath students with a space to create and share their notes with other students on their course. There are no plans to release this system, nor continue development of this system; although the idea for this system is fine, this project involved learning a number of different libraries thus a number of different files need work. 

This website was created using React, ExpressJS, and MySQL.
